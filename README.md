IDEA:

We are aiming to solve the traffic congestion problem by optimising the signal timer durations. This will be done by setting the timers proportional to their respective road traffic density. 
Do take a look at the Presentation Created by Us: 




HOW:

Traffic Density will be tracked using a ‘Traffic Flow’ API. This traffic density data will be used in real-time to calculate the wait time for each signal. So, for eg on a 4-way crossroad, if one of the roads has a greater traffic density, then, the signal wait time will be proportionally lower. 




REPO:

STEP 1: Calculate the Traffic Signal Timer formula for a Cross-Road. (Used Random Integer Instead of Real Time Data)

STEP 2: Accessing Real Time Data. (Trial was Done Using TomTom API - Later Shifted to AZURE MAPS API)

FILE: Signal Timer Model 2.ipynb

STEP 3: Integration of STEP 1 and STEP 2 - Using Real Time data with Signal Timer Algorithm
